//Given ATM Object with a checking and savings account
//Need to make ATM object functional, how do we do that?
//Make sure functions are not longer than five lines,(Sandi Metz's Rule 2)

//Test that the Javascript library, jQuery is working

$(document).ready(function(){
// Uh oh -- it's saying `$` is undefined! Something's missing from `index.html`...
});

//Users of the ATM object with a Checking Account
//Users of the ATM object can deposit money into bank account
//Set the value of 0 to equal red


//Create an event that listens for click on deposit button from user when a deposit is made
//When deposit button is clicked it will console.log('hello')


//When deposit button is clicked it will return the userinput
//When userinput is returned it will console.log('get money')

//When the deposit button is clicked, the balance container will update (in add. to current) with userinput


//Users of the ATM object can withdraw money from bank account
//Create an event that listens for click on withdraw button from user when a withdraw is made
//When withdraw button is clicked it will console.log('bye')

//When withdrawn button is clicked it will return the userinput
//When userinput is returned it will console.log('ballin')

//When the withdraw button is clicked, the balance container will update (in add. to current) with userinput
