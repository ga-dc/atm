Goals:

- Users can deposit money into one of the bank accounts
- Users can withdraw money from one of the bank accounts
- Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
- The color of a bank account should reflect its balance. (There's a CSS class called .zero already written for this.)
- You may edit the HTML file (but might not need to).

Suggested commits:

CHECKING ACCOUNT

1. Test jQuery is working
Make the <body>'s background color turn red
>Link jQuery
>Console log hello


2. Add a click listener to the checking account's "Deposit" button
When you click the button it should console.log("hello")
> Use jquery to grab the deposit button
> Create an event listener on click
> Return console log to test


3. On clicking "Deposit", it should get the user input
Just console.log it
You can save some time by hard-coding a value into the input box: <input value="something" />. That way you don't need to type stuff in all the time to test it.
> Change return val() of user input upon click
> Print in console log as test


4. On clicking "Deposit", it should update the "balance" with the user input
Just make the user input show up. Don't worry about actually keeping track of a balance yet.
> Create variable storing the balance, similar to seconds in timer exercise
> Print number


5. On "Deposit", it should get the current "balance"
How can you get the content of the "balance" element?
The content has a $ at the beginning of it, so Javascript will read it as text rather than as a number. How can you convert this text into a number?
> Update the balance while removing the $


6. On "Deposit", it updates the balance
Now add the user input to the balance, and make it show up in the "balance" element
> Same as in timer exercise


On "Withdraw", it updates the balance
Follow the same steps as before, except you're subtracting instead of adding
> Review code and mirror new events for withdraw clicks

> Repeat for savings

> Make sure withdraw can't happen if withdraw > balance in either account
> Prompt that they can only withdraw what is remaining
> If balance is zero, make color red 

Refactor the existing code
Challenge: Try to have no function() that's longer than 5 lines. (Sandi Metz's Rule 2)
